Hi everyone,
This project explores bike sales analysis through an interactive dashboard created using MS Excel. 
Leveraging a dataset encompassing various demographic and socio-economic factors such as marital status, gender, income, education, and more, the dashboard offers insightful visualizations and trends. 
Users can delve into correlations between variables like commute distance, region, and age against bike purchases. 
This endeavor not only sheds light on consumer behavior but also demonstrates the power of data visualization in extracting actionable insights. 
From demographic segmentation to predictive modeling, this project encapsulates a comprehensive approach to understanding bike sales dynamics.
